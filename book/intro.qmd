The ACL rehabilitation protocol is a **criteria-driven** program
designed for both clinicians and individuals post-ACL reconstruction.
Progression is determined by meeting specific goals rather than by fixed
timelines.

**Key tips for progression:** - Achieve full knee extension early - Use
swelling and pain as a guide - Focus on correct biomechanics - Build
high-impact forces gradually - Complete the full rehabilitation protocol
