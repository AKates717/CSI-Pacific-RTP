The ACL rehabilitation protocol is a **criteria-driven** program designed for both clinicians and individuals post-ACL reconstruction. Progression is determined by meeting specific goals rather than by fixed timelines.

**Key tips for progression:**
- Achieve full knee extension early
- Use swelling and pain as a guide
- Focus on correct biomechanics
- Build high-impact forces gradually
- Complete the full rehabilitation protocol
