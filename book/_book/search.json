Every athlete will move through the rehabilitation at their own pace, allowing the criteria to govern progression. Occasionally, estimated time-lines will be cited in order to provide some temporal context for the rehabilitation, but it is important to remember that every ACL injury and rehab is different, and that allowing the criteria to dictate progression will keep the process on track and ultimately lead to the most successful return to performance.\nThis protocol is different from previously published ACL Rehabilitation Protocols in that it is a living document, fully integrated with all of the athlete’s data and unique information needed to tailor the process to the individual. Some advantages of this approach include:",

    "text": "A Note To The Athlete\n\nA foundational objective of this protocol is to be as open as possible, and to facilitate sharing of information. We aim to provide you the resources needed to understand the process and take ownership over your rehab.\nWith that said, much of the information in this book is targeted towards a multidisciplinary team of practitioners with advanced education in human movement and experience guiding injury rehabilitation. This protocol should provide a framework for each of these professionals to participate in an athlete-centred approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no expectation for you to read this e-book front-to-back, but all of the information is there for you to engage with as you wish, and of course, questions are always encouraged!",

Practitioners and decision makers should be able to follow along and obtain a clear picture of WHAT needs to be accomplished and also HOW to accomplish it. While this document is meant as a comprehensive resource, it is important to acknowledge that there will always be many different ways to approach any situation. Not all practitioners will agree on the optimal approach at all times, and that is okay. A primary goal of this document is to serve as a starting point for productive collaboration between all practitioners involved in the rehab process. Used effectively, this resource should help an integrated service team deliver the best possible rehab for the athlete. The protocol alone does not ensure a strong and successful return to performance; such an outcome will depend first and foremost on the dedicated and attentive delivery of the protocol by skilled practitioners.",

    "text": "What does the research say?\nThis chapter will focus exclusively on the time period between ACL injury and ACL Repair surgery (ACLR) and the objectives associated with the best outcomes throughout the rehabilitation. It is not always possible to choose the exact date of surgery, and the selection of the optimal pre-ACLR window is beyond the scope of this protocol, rather the goal here is to provide the information and tools to optimize this phase of the rehab. As seen below, Frank Reynolds has 8 days to prepare for surgery.\nRegardless of the length of the prehab window, the research is clear that the length of time between injury and surgery is far less important than the quality of pre-ACLR care provided [1]. Current research has found the following most important areas of focus at this stage:\nFrank Reynolds’s progress towards these goals will be assessed via the criteria seen below. Detailed description of each criteria and the associated testing methodology can be found in the Testing section.\nRecent systematic reviews support the implementation of an appropriate prehab exercise program prior to surgery, while highlighting the importance of allowing the knee to regain normal physiologic motion, and describing relevant protocols and strategies [2–4]. The first two systematic reviews were published in 2020 and included 6 and 3 studies respectively, whereas the most recent review published in 2025 included 36 different studies, highlighting the recent explosion of interest in ACLR prehab [4]. This review described both the characteristics of current ACLR prehab programs in the literature and the clinical outcomes that have been reported pre- and post-surgery. The results show that current ACLR prehab practices emphasize impairment resolution (i.e. pain and swelling), ROM restoration and neuromuscular exercises, and that these criteria are associated with improved short and long-term clinical outcomes.\nAmong studies comparing patients who completed a prehab program to those who did not, results suggest that prehab is a potentially effective intervention for yielding short- to long-term post-operative functional benefits. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a validated self-assessment tool used to score pain, function in activities of daily living, function in sport/recreation, knee related quality of life, and “other symptoms” [5]. Individuals participating in ACLR prehab are shown to have significantly better KOOS outcome scores pre-operatively and at two years [6] and 10 years [7] post-operation. These results are also associated with notably faster recovery of knee function, ROM and knee-extensor strength [8] and further supported by evidence that limited knee ROM prior to ACLR has been associated with delays in the recovery of knee ROM post-surgery [9]. A further notable finding from the systematic reviews is that there were no reported incidents of preoperative complications arising from any of the studies, indicating that prehab is a safe method of improving post-operative outcomes [4].\nWhile it seems clear that ACLR prehab can be a potentially effective intervention, there remains a need for further research in this area, particularly regarding specific exercise details and protocol progression. It must be noted that there is currently no consensus or gold-standard ACLR Prehab program, likely because there are too many variables to consider for each individual. There are, however, a few published protocols [11–13], and these have been used to inform the CSI Pacific ACLR Phase 0 testing and training protocols.",
