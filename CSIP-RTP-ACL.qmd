# Introduction {#introduction}

The ACL rehabilitation protocol on this page is desgined as a comprehensive resource for CSI Pacific Staff, and any Integrated Service Team members, or sport partners who contribute to rehabilitation of Canadian high performance athletes.

Some of the goals of this document are as follows:

-   To gather the best available evidence on ACL rehabilitation and to organize that information in a way that is directly actionable for practitioners
-   To facilitate seamless collaboration between any staff or IST members who are serving the rehabilitating athlete.
-   To enable meticulous tracking of every aspect of an ACL rehab, so we can deliver the best rehab possible while also learning what we can improve for future cases
-

The ACL rehabilitation protocol is a **criteria-driven** program designed for both clinicians and individuals post-ACL reconstruction. Progression is determined by meeting specific goals rather than by fixed timelines.

**Key tips for progression:**\
- Achieve full knee extension early\
- Use swelling and pain as a guide\
- Focus on correct biomechanics\
- Build high-impact forces gradually\
- Complete the full rehabilitation protocol

-   Regain 90% quadriceps and hamstring strength vs. other side\
:::

**Typical activities:**\
- Icing, ROM exercises, cycling, progressive strengthening.\
- Avoid aggressive change of direction.

See [Outcome Measures for Pre-Op](#preop-outcomes).

## Outcome Measures {#preop-outcomes}

|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Passive Knee Extension | Supine with long arm goniometer | 0° |
| Passive Knee Flexion | Supine with long arm goniometer | 125°+ |
| Strength | Hand-held dynamometer (quads & hamstrings) | ≥ 90% symmetry |
| Swelling/Effusion | Stroke Test | 0–1+ |
| Single Hop Test | Average of two hops | ≥ 90% symmetry |
