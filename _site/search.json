While the home page provides a quick snapshot of your progress, each dashboard provides a deep dive into the specific aspects of the rehab.\nDashboards will be most useful to practitioners who want to disect the progress of specific metrics or to check if training is affecting certain metrics as planned. This can be very helpful for making detailed tweaks to the training programs. These are different than progress reports, in that they provide very specific information about singular aspects of the rehab, whereas the progress reports track progress towards specific goals and summarize information more broadly.\n\nCurrent and planned dashboards are linked below:\n\nForce Plates\nWellness Monitoring (coming soon)\n\nKnee pain, swelling, well-being, mental readiness\n\nStrength tests (coming soon)\nHop Tests (coming soon)"

Progression is determined by meeting specific goals rather than by fixed timelines.\nKey tips for progression:\n- Achieve full knee extension early\n- Use swelling and pain as a guide\n- Focus on correct biomechanics\n- Build high-impact forces gradually\n- Complete the full rehabilitation protocol\n\nPre-Op: Injury recovery & readiness for surgery\nPhase 1: Recovery from surgery\nPhase 2: Strength & neuromuscular control\nPhase 3: Running, agility, and landings\nPhase 4: Return to sport\nPhase 5: Prevention of re-injury"
