    "text": "The ACL rehabilitation protocol on this page is desgined as a comprehensive resource for CSI Pacific Staff, and any Integrated Service Team members, or sport partners who contribute to rehabilitation of Canadian high performance athletes.\nSome of the goals of this document are as follows:\n\nTo gather the best available evidence on ACL rehabilitation and to organize that information in a way that is directly actionable for practitioners\nTo facilitate seamless collaboration between any staff or IST members who are serving the rehabilitating athlete.\nTo enable meticulous tracking of every aspect of an ACL rehab, so we can deliver the best rehab possible while also learning what we can improve for future cases\n\n\n\n\nThe ACL rehabilitation protocol is a criteria-driven program designed for both clinicians and individuals post-ACL reconstruction. Progression is determined by meeting specific goals rather than by fixed timelines.\nKey tips for progression:\n- Achieve full knee extension early\n- Use swelling and pain as a guide\n- Focus on correct biomechanics\n- Build high-impact forces gradually\n- Complete the full rehabilitation protocol\n\n Pre-Op: Injury recovery & readiness for surgery\n Phase 1: Recovery from surgery\n Phase 2: Strength & neuromuscular control\n Phase 3: Running, agility, and landings\n Phase 4: Return to sport\n Phase 5: Prevention of re-injury"
