    "text": "The ACL rehabilitation protocol on this page is designed as a comprehensive resource for CSI Pacific Staff, and any Integrated Service Team members, or sport partners who contribute to rehabilitation of Canadian high performance athletes.\nSome of the goals of this document are as follows:\n\nTo gather the best available evidence on ACL rehabilitation and to organize that information in a way that is directly actionable for practitioners\nTo facilitate seamless collaboration between any staff or IST members who are serving the rehabilitating athlete.\nTo enable meticulous tracking of every aspect of an ACL rehab, so we can deliver the best rehab possible while also learning what we can improve for future cases\n\n\n\n\nThe ACL rehabilitation protocol is a criteria-driven program designed for both clinicians and individuals post-ACL reconstruction. Progression is determined by meeting specific goals rather than by fixed timelines.\nKey tips for progression:\n- Achieve full knee extension early\n- Use swelling and pain as a guide\n- Focus on correct biomechanics\n- Build high-impact forces gradually\n- Complete the full rehabilitation protocol\n\nPre-Op: Injury recovery & readiness for surgery\nPhase 1: Recovery from surgery\nPhase 2: Strength & neuromuscular control\nPhase 3: Running, agility, and landings\nPhase 4: Return to sport\nPhase 5: Prevention of re-injury"

While the home page provides a quick snapshot of your progress, each dashboard provides a deep dive into the specific aspects of the rehab.\nDashboards will be most useful to practitioners who want to disect the progress of specific metrics or to check if training is affecting certain metrics as planned. This can be very helpful for making detailed tweaks to the training programs. These are different than progress reports, in that they provide very specific information about singular aspects of the rehab, whereas the progress reports track progress towards specific goals and summarize information more broadly.\n\nCurrent and planned dashboards are linked below:\n\nForce Plates\nWellness Monitoring (coming soon)\n\nKnee pain, swelling, well-being, mental readiness\n\nStrength tests (coming soon)\nHop Tests (coming soon)"

    "text": "Progress Reports\nAny successful and durable ACL rehabilitation must be criteria-based. By creating progress reports with a “checklist” format, every practitioner involved in a rehab can see exactly what the athlete has and hasn’t accomplished, making it clear when athletes should advance to the next phase of rehab or be cleared for progression of activities. At the same time, these tools allow the athlete to clearly visualize their progress and to have a solid understanding of what they need to accomplish in order to progress through the rehab safely.\nChecklists can be used to track:\n\nProgress through the phases of rehab\n\nPhase 1\nPhase 2\nPhase 3\nPhase 4\nPhase 5\n\nClearance for activities. Different activities require different physical capacities, and therefore require unique criteria to determine the optimal time for a safe return.
