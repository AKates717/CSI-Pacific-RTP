    "text": "Introduction\nThis ACL rehabilitation protocol is designed as a comprehensive resource for every person involved in a rehab, starting with the athlete them-self. This document will allow the athlete to take ownership of the rehabilitation process and to know exactly how they are progressing throughout the journey. Although the athlete is at the centre of this process at all times, this document is technical and scientific, and will provide CSI Pacific staff, Integrated Service Team (IST) members, and other sport partner personnel with a thoroughly-researched, evidence-based plan to help the athlete return to performance.\nThis process aligns closely with CSI Pacific’s goals to Collaborate, Serve, Innovate and Perform.\nCollaborate: This tool facilitates seamless collaboration amongst every member of the athlete’s support team. All information will be in one place and everybody will have the opportunity to be on the same page.\nServe: An athlete-centred approach, combined with a\nInnovate: This ambitious protocol, centred on meticulous data management is unique in the field of injury rehabilitation. It allows us to continually provide best-practice service, and to learn and grow with every successful rehab.\nPerform: This protocol is backed by the latest scientific research as well as the experience of expert-level practitioners who have led successful rehabilitations for some of Canada’s top athletes. This protocol, combined with the dedication and hard work of CSI Pacific practitioners will give athletes the best possible chance of a successful return to performance.\nImportantly, this protocol is criteria-based. Every athlete will move through the rehabilitation at their own pace, allowing the criteria to govern progression. Occasionally, rough time-lines will be cited in order to provide some temporal context for the rehabilitation, but it is important to remember that every ACL injury and rehab is different, and that allowing the criteria to dictate progression will keep the process on track and ultimately lead to the most successful return to performance.\nThis protocol is different from previously published ACL Rehabilitation Protocols in that it is a living document, fully integrated with all of the athlete’s data and unique information needed to tailor the process to the individual. Some advantages of this approach include:",
